                                Ryan Williams or “Bad Little King” as he is
                                known when on the decks, began spinning in 2015
                                while attending Scottsdale Community College for
                                Electronic Music and Music Business. It was
                                during his internship with local Arizona legend
                                DJ Tranzit that he fell in love with House
                                music. It wasn’t long before he began his first
                                weekly show in the summer of 2016 at Culinary
                                Dropout in Old Town, spinning Deep House and
                                Tropical House for three hours every Sunday
                                afternoon. He has become the resident DJ for the
                                Culinary Dropouts throughout the valley, playing
                                multiple weekends a month.

                            In early 2018 Ryan realized there was an
                            opportunity, Scottsdale did not have anywhere for
                            people to listen to House Music. In the Spring of
                            2018 he met Mike Cheathem, a fellow House Music
                            enthusiast, and the General Manager of Scapegoat
                            Beer and Wine in Old Town. Together they started
                            their very own night where once a month, the
                            denizens of Scottsdale could come out and listen to
                            House music.

                            In June of 2018 he released his long awaited remix
                            of RL Grime’s “I Wanna Know” as a free download on
                            his Soundcloud. In October 2018, he played for
                            idgaFunk’s Haunted House Party at Loco Patron on
                            Mill Ave, and the Bubble Room in Old Town
                            Scottsdale. Primarily spinning Tech House and
                            G-House, Bad Little King has always found his home
                            in the darker sides of house music, and has begun to
                            make a name for himself in the Phoenix House music
                            community.
