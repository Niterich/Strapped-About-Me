                                Ryan Williams or “Bad Little King” as he is
                                known when on the decks, began spinning in 2015
                                while attending Scottsdale Community College for
                                Electronic Music and Music Business. It was
                                during his internship with local Arizona legend
                                DJ Tranzit that he fell in love with House
                                music. It wasn’t long before he began his first
                                weekly show in the summer of 2016 at Culinary
                                Dropout in Old Town, spinning Deep House and
                                Tropical House for three hours every Sunday
                                afternoon. He has become the resident DJ for the
                                Culinary Dropouts throughout the valley, playing
                                multiple weekends a month.

                                    In early 2018 Ryan realized there was an opportunity,
                                    Scottsdale did not have anywhere for people to listen to
                                    House Music. In the Spring of 2018 he met Mike Cheathem,
                                    a fellow House Music enthusiast, and the General Manager
                                    of Scapegoat Beer and Wine in Old Town. Together they
                                    started their very own night where once a month, the
                                    denizens of Scottsdale could come out and listen to
                                    House music.

                                    In June of 2018 he released his long awaited remix of RL
                                    Grime’s “I Wanna Know” as a free download on his
                                    Soundcloud. In October 2018, he played for idgaFunk’s
                                    Haunted House Party at Loco Patron on Mill Ave, and the
                                    Bubble Room in Old Town Scottsdale. Primarily spinning
                                    Tech House and G-House, Bad Little King has always found
                                    his home in the darker sides of house music, and has
                                    begun to make a name for himself in the Phoenix House
                                    music community.
